# Musthave Cookies

Musthave Cookies is a CLI tool that allows you to quickly identify which cookies are actually required by the server to maintain session state, access authenticated resources, or avoid redirection/denial responses.

## Purpose

When testing a new application, youâ€™re often overwhelmed with 50+ cookies. 

This tool helps you immediately answer:

    Which cookies does the server actually depend on for this endpoint?

Musthave Cookies systematically removes one cookie at a time and measures server response changes (status code + content length) to identify the minimum set of cookies required to maintain access.


## Installation

+ Python 3.6+

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/webvenv/musthave-cookies.git
cd musthave-cookies

# Create and Activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install required package
pip install requests

# Run the tool
python3 mhcookies.py request.txt
```


## Usage

1. Copy a raw HTTP request (taken from Burp Suite/Caido) and paste it inside a text file: `request.txt`

*Inside `request.txt`...*

```
GET /path/endpoint?param=value HTTP/1.1
Host: sub.domain.com
Cookie: session-id=123-456; abcd-id=261-4866016; lc-acbae=en_US; sid="abcdefghijklmopqrstuvwxyz|1234567"; session-id-time=2379336985l; session-token="123-456-789"; x-acbae="a1b2c3d4e5f6g7"; at-acbae=ABC123DEF456; sess-at-acbae="0987654321zyxwuvt"; sst-acbae=5555-5555

2. Pass the raw HTTP request file as an argument when executing the script.

```
python3 mhcookies.py request.txt
```

    
## Use Cases

+ Reduce noise when testing high-cookie apps
+ Quickly find session dependencies
+ Detect session fixation or fallback behaviors
+ Build automation pipelines with minimal cookie state
+ Clean up Burp/Intruder/ffuf payloads
